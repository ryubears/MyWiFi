# MyWiFi2
MyWiFi is an Android app that works as a WiFi manager that automatically turns on the WiFi whenever a user enters a registered place of his or her choice. It aims to prevent users from wasting their data unnecessary in an environment where WiFi is available. It utilizes Google Locations API (Place Picker, Geofences) and stores its data in a SQLite Database.
